### Projects


 
**Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MCCAI)**                              

TOOTHFAIRY2 Grand Challenge based on Multi-Structure Segmentation in CBCT Volume

nnU-Net V2 for automated model optimization exemplifies their dedication to advancing medical diagnostics through technology. This project not only aims to excel in the ToothFairy 2024 challenge but also sets a benchmark for future research in automated deep learning applications in medical imaging.

 Dependencies 
 
•	numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, and SimpleITK. 

•	nnU-Net V2 framework

•	These libraries are critical for data manipulation, machine learning operations, and medical image processing, providing a robust foundation for the algorithms.



**DICOM Viewer and Converter**


Python based script for viewing and converting DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) files. DICOM is the standard format for medical imaging data, and this script provides a simple and efficient way to visualize these images and convert them into more commonly used formats like PNG and JPEG.

Dependencies

•	pydicom: For reading DICOM files

•	matplotlib: For displaying DICOM images

•	Pillow: For converting DICOM images to other formats

•	numpy: For numerical operations and normalization of image data.
